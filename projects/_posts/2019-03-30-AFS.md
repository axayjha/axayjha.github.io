A trivial file system (emulating unix FS) simulation that can create directories and files on a simulated disk block

Using this system, user can manage a virtual disk image by creating a file system on it. File creation, deletion and manipulation can be simulated using this system. All the data manipulated will stay on a virtual disk image. Files from the unix/linux file system can be copied into a virtual disk image using this file system simulation and also vice versa. File system information can be viewed using the debug command. Inode information can be viewed using the stat command. General information about all commands can be viewed using help command. To exit the shell, there is a quit command.
