Encrypto is a little Python script which encrypts plain text into ciphers using a modified version of Vignere algorithm. It uses tkinter to paint GUI for the application.

The encryption algorithm used is a very simple extension to normal vignere encryption, where instead of 26 rows and columns in vignere table, we have 94 X 94 table which includes all characters from a standard US keyboard.

Coded in and for Python 3.x
