  <h1>You Have Graduated</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="article">
<p style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 18px; text-align:justify">
<span style="font-size: 40px; font-style: bold">S</span>o, you have graduated. The results are out and you got the passing grades.
It has been a tough journey, I know. Exhausting and dispiriting at times, I can
relate.
The numerous and frequent exams, the lengthy and boring assignments, gruelling
long lectures
and compulsory attendance in 3/4 of them. <br /><br />

But as if all of this wasn’t enough, we are laid down with another burden.
The burden of <span style="font-style: italic">judgement</span>. A grade is assigned to you; you are put into a
category.
Based on how much you could recall from the mugging of previous couple of days
before exam,
maybe on how perfect curves can you bring into your writing, and also possibly
on the condition that your examiner had no fight with his wife on the morning of
paper checking.<br /><br />

Now once you are assigned a number, you’re all set to be judged. Not just
academically, but for <span style="font-style: italic">all your self-worth</span>. If your pets had some scores
for
their playfulness, you’d be compared to them too.<br /><br />

A good category gives you the ability to grow unicorn horns! No, just kidding.
But it does come with lots of perks. For instance, you get to have
<span style="font-style: italic">reservation</span> in elective subject lottery. You get to have your way when it
comes
to nominations for any volunteering work in the institution. Everyone loves and
adores you. Professors would probably take you out for lunch (if they
could).<br /><br />

But if your stars turn out as playful as your pets and don’t agree to align, and
you somehow fall into a less fortunate category, then all the best to you. It
could be so that people forget that you even exist. You won’t make it to
probably top 20 of considerations for even non-academic works. People would come
to you though, <span style="font-style: italic">after</span> the results, to take a measure of how good
<span style="font-style: italic">they</span> have done.<br /><br />

I hold no grudges against the top-scorers, and have no particular love for the
low-graders. All I have, in plenty, is a loathe for the system. A system where a
decimal number represents your capability. The first relevant data on any resume
after your name is most likely to be that number. This isn’t even the most
troubling part. The more troubling fact is that this system can be hacked. 
<span style="font-style: italic">Easily</span>. Anyone can rig this grading scheme. All it takes is a strong will
and
directed dedication to score good on a particular set of questions.<br /><br />

I am no one to judge anyone and I don’t intend to be guilty of a crime that I
mean to outface. However, I have seen the most vacuous of heads with full grown
unicorn horns. They dally with a certain ebullience, flaunting that horn of
theirs. And everyone notices them, admires and idolises them.
Again, I have no complaint against the admiration anyone gets. It just happens
so that almost everyone is admired and known for wrong reasons in this system.
It’s like a person who’s a great swordsman gets the certificate of being called
the top-archer at the end. Or a person who knows nothing about conjuring magic
gets to become the sorcerer supreme based on their rote knowledge of the
spells.<br /><br />

So, what is the solution to this unfairness? It’s simpler than you can imagine.
Just don’t pay heed to it! Don’t believe in this flawed system. At the end of
the day, no one actually does. In fact, in 3-tier colleges like ours, even
recruiters take separate examinations to filter out some of those fake unicorn
horns. So do post-grad universities everywhere. Then why should we fall for it?<br />
Have faith in yourself, believe in your self-worth. Don’t let your numbers and
tags tell you otherwise. If you have been lagging behind till now, it means you
have been in the wrong race all this while. Even a champion cyclist can’t beat
an F1 racer in their track, doesn’t mean he/she is any less.<br />
I would also plead you to try and recognize the talent where it lies. Don’t make
beef-witted people famous. The people who I admire the most in my circle are
some of those who are hardly popular otherwise or are popular for all the
wrong reasons.<br />
I know people who are great singers, dancers, poets, ones who can conjure magic
with keyboards and guitars, those who bring sketches to life using pencil and
paper, those who can paint what is hard to even imagine for others, those who are winning
tournaments for their football and cricket teams, those who eat up books like
cookies, those who write engrossing stories, and articles so clever they force
you to think, and those who can actually make computers work at their will – <span style="font-style: italic">the
real computer science engineers</span>. And people hardly know these 7-point, 8-point
something in their academic circle for what they are.<br />
Grades mean nothing. Grades take you nowhere. Your children won’t know you for
your grades. Grades give you a false sense of judgment that will make no sense
when the person without a horn outdoes you one day in life.
<br /><br />

Move on and appreciate people for what they are; <span style="font-style: italic">value yourself for what you are</span>, for you are out of that
corroded system now. <br /><b><span style="font-style: italic">You have graduated.</span></b><br /><br />
