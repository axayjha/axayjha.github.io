		    <h2>Aladdin - Three Cheesy Wishes</h2>
		    <p style="line-height:28px">
		    	Long ago, before there was an Aladdin, a Jasmine, or even a Sultan, the magic lamp was making its way towards the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin would one day find it. A travelling merchant had bought the lamp, along with some other 'junk'. Not knowing its value, he sold it to a cheese seller for some lunch. 
		    	<br/><br/>
				Hassan the cheese seller looked at the lamp sceptically. He sighed, and began to shine it up. In a puff of smoke, the Genie appeared. 
				<br/><br/>
				"Hello there! I'm the one and only magical Genie!" the big blue spirit announced. 
				<br/>
				"Excuse me?" said Hassan. 
				<br/>
				"Nice to meet you," said the Genie. "And what do you do here in Agrabah?"
				<br/>
				"My name is Hassan, and I'm a-"
				<br/>
				"Wait!" cried the Genie. "Let me guess! They say I'm a little psychic, you know!"
				<br/>
				The Genie put his hand over his brow as he secretly looked around the man's shop.
				"You sell...cheese! Am I right or am I right?"
				<br/>
				"You are right," said Hassan. "But that's an easy guess. Not very magical."
				<br/>
				"You're very  observant, Hassan," said the Genie. "So I'll give you three wishes."
				<br/>
				"Three wishes, eh?" Hassan thought for a few minutes. Then he said, "It's hard to get enough good milk to make the best cheese. I wish I had many, many goats so I would always have enough milk."
				<br/><br/>				
				<em>Poof!</em> In a flash, thousands of goats filled the streets of Agrabah. Goats were everywhere! The crowded the little shop, and knocked over the stalls in the market.
				<br/>
				"Goodness!" Hassan cried. "I would have to wish for the biggest cheese shop in the world to sell the cheese from so many goats."
				<br/><br/>
				<em>Poof!</em> All of a sudden, Hassan's store began to grow and grow! His cheese shop was even taller than the highest sand dunes outside the city.
				<br/>
				"This is terrible!" Hassan cried. Far below, the people looked like tiny ants. "I can't live and work in such a monstrosity. All I wanted was to make the finest cheese in Agrabah."
				<br/>
				Hassan turned to the Genie. "I wish I'd never met you!" he cried.
				<br/><br/>
				<em>Poof!</em> Suddenly, the Genie was gone. Hassan found his shop back to normal. Outside, the marketplace was completely goat free.
				<br/>
				Hassan searched high and low for the lamp, but it was already tucked into a little boy's pocket. Where would it end up next?
				<br/>
				"It must have all been a crazy dream" said Hassan.
				<br/>
				But, from that day, everyone said Hassan's cheese was the finest in all of Agrabah!
