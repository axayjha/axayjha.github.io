                        <article class="articlecolumn">
                                <h2>You have graduated</h2>
                                <p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 18px; text-align:justify">
                                        So, you have graduated. The results are out and you got the passing grades.
                                        It has been a tough journey, I know. Exhausting and dispiriting at times, I can
                                        relate.
                                        The numerous and frequent exams, the lengthy and boring assignments, gruelling
                                        long lectures
                                        and compulsory attendance in 3/4 of them. <br><br>

                                        But as if all of this wasn’t enough, we are laid down with another burden.
                                        The burden of <b>judgement</b>. A grade is assigned to you; you are put into a
                                        category.
                                        Based on how much you could recall from the mugging of previous couple of days
                                        before exam,
                                        maybe on how perfect curves can you bring into your writing, and also possibly
                                        on the condition that your examiner had no fight with his wife on the morning of
                                        paper checking.<br><br>

                                        Now once you are assigned a number, you’re all set to be judged. Not just
                                        academically, but for <b>all your self-worth</b>. If your pets had some scores
                                        for
                                        their playfulness, you’d be compared to them too.<br><br>

                                        A good category gives you the ability to grow unicorn horns! No, just kidding.
                                        But it does come with lots of perks. For instance, you get to have
                                        <b>reservation</b> in elective subject lottery. You get to have your way when it
                                        comes
                                        to nominations for any volunteering work in the institution. Everyone loves and
                                        adores you. Professors would probably take you out for lunch (if they
                                        could).<br><br>

                                        But if your stars turn out as playful as your pets and don’t agree to align, and
                                        you somehow fall into a less fortunate category, then all the best to you. It
                                        could be so that people forget that you even exist. You won’t make it to
                                        probably top 20 of considerations for even non-academic works. People would come
                                        to you though, <b>after</b> the results, to take a measure of how good
                                        <b>they</b> have done.<br><br>

                                        I hold no grudges against the top-scorers, and have no particular love for the
                                        low-graders. All I have, in plenty, is a loathe for the system. A system where a
                                        decimal number represents your capability. The first relevant data on any resume
                                        after your name is most likely to be that number. This isn’t even the most
                                        troubling part. The more troubling fact is that this system can be hacked.
                                        <b>Easily</b>. Anyone can rig this grading scheme. All it takes is a strong will
                                        and
                                        directed dedication to score good on a particular set of questions.<br><br>

                                        I am no one to judge anyone and I don’t intend to be guilty of a crime that I
                                        mean to outface. However, I have seen the most vacuous of heads with full grown
                                        unicorn horns. They dally with a certain ebullience, flaunting that horn of
                                        theirs. And everyone notices them, admires and idolises them.
                                        Again, I have no complaint against the admiration anyone gets. It just happens
                                        so that almost everyone is admired and known for wrong reasons in this system.
                                        It’s like a person who’s a great swordsman gets the certificate of being called
                                        the top-archer at the end. Or a person who knows nothing about conjuring magic
                                        gets to become the sorcerer supreme based on their rote knowledge of the
                                        spells.<br><br>

                                        So, what is the solution to this unfairness? It’s simpler than you can imagine.
                                        Just don’t pay heed to it! Don’t believe in this flawed system. At the end of
                                        the day, no one actually does. In fact, in 3-tier colleges like ours, even
                                        recruiters take separate examinations to filter out some of those fake unicorn
                                        horns. So do post-grad universities everywhere. Then why should we fall for it?<br>
                                        Have faith in yourself, believe in your self-worth. Don’t let your numbers and
                                        tags tell you otherwise. If you have been lagging behind till now, it means you
                                        have been in the wrong race all this while. Even a champion cyclist can’t beat
                                        an F1 racer in their track, doesn’t mean he/she is any less.<br>
                                        I would also plead you to try and recognize the talent where it lies. Don’t make
                                        beef-witted people famous. The people who I admire the most in my circle are
                                        some of those who are hardly popular otherwise or are popular for all the
                                        wrong reasons.<br>
                                        I know people who are great singers, dancers, poets, ones who can conjure magic
                                        with keyboards and guitars, those who bring sketches to life using pencil and
                                        paper, those who can paint what’s hard to even imagine for others, those who are winning
                                        tournaments for their football and cricket teams, those who eat up books like
                                        cookies, those who write engrossing stories, and articles so clever they force
                                        you to think, and those who can actually make computers work at their will – the
                                        real computer science engineers. And people hardly know these 7-point, 8-point
                                        something in their academic circle for what they are.<br>
                                        Grades mean nothing. Grades take you nowhere. Your children won’t know you for
                                        your grades. Grades give you a false sense of judgment that will make no sense
                                        when the person without a horn outdoes you one day in life.
                                        <br><br>

                                        Move on and appreciate people for what they are; value yourself for what you are, for you are out of that
                                        corroded system now. <b>You have graduated.</b><br><br>
