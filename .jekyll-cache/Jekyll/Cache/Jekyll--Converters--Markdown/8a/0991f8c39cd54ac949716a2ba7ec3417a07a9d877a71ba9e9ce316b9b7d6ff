I"¨<h4>Getting started with MASM 8086 assembly</h4>
<p><b>Why suddenly 8086 assembly using MASM? </b><br />
Well, partly because I love exploring random legacy system programming
and partly because I stumbled upon this book called â€œC using Assembly Languageâ€ 
by Steven Holzner (1989). Author has used Quick C and Microsoft Micro Assembler
to demonstrate use cases. So here I am, experimenting with stuffs.<br /><br /></p>
