I"Ï<h4>Implementing an algorithm by modelling an FSM in an HDL </h4>
<p>We are going to use Verilog for this project. So, any verilog compiler and simulator should do. 
Xilinx and ModelSim are really good tools. But since Iâ€™m a *nix guy, Iâ€™m going to use 
<b>Icarus Verilog</b> to compile code and <b>gtkwave</b> to view the signal timing diagrams.
They are free to use, easy to learn and much more light-weight than other full-fledged options. <br /><br /></p>
